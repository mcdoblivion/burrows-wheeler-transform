UET - MCN - INT3305 2 Assignment
===============

Simple file compressor using Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and then finally compressed by the Run Length Encoding (
RLE) and Move to Front Transform (MFT) techniques.

## Instructions

Run pre written tests:

* Open a terminal in root folder of the project
* Run `python tests/compress.py`
* This will compress all .txt files present in tests folder
* Run `python tests/decompress.py`
* This will decompress all .h files present in tests folder (Note: Decompression may take some time)

Cleaning .h and .lulz files:

* Run `python tests/clean.py`
* This will delete all .h and .lulz files present in tests folder

To test it manually:

* Open a terminal in root folder of the project
* put a text file you want to compress in tests folder
* Run `python core compress tests/filename.txt`
* Run `python core decompress tests/filename.txt.h`

## Project Structure

### knit folder contains code for BWT, MTF, RLE and huffman in python

* bwt.py file has code for coding and decoding in BWT
* mtf.py file has code for coding and decoding in MTF
* rle.py file has code for coding and decoding in RLE
* huffman.py file has code for compressing and decompressing in Huffman

### tests folder contains test scripts and test cases

* compress.py file is a small script which finds all txt files in tests folder and compresses them
* decompress.py file is a small script which finds all txt files in tests folder and decompresses them
* clean.py file is a small script which deletes all .h and .lulz files in tests folder
